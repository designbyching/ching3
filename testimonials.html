                only does it relate to the products we sell, but he also took
                the time to incorporate the deeper meaning behind the brand
                through a cultural lens—respecting Indigenous Australia in the
                process. Thank you!”

                “It’s a rare experience to be able to place 100% trust in a
                project from start to finish. I’ve worked with Mike in a
                different capacity many years ago, so he was always going to be
                my first choice for Ozstream’s new logo and branding. Mike is a
                creative genius; he works with you to fully understand your
                business to create something new, imaginative, and unique to
                your strategy. I can’t tell you how much it pleased me to
                release the reins and set Mike free to do what he does best. I
                knew exactly where Mike had my project at each step, and what I
                could expect by our next meeting. If you’re considering a new
                logo or brand identity, look no further than Design by Ching. I

                “Beauty Quest was my brainchild, and I did a lot of dreaming to
                bring it to life. Sometimes, when you’re so passionate, you can
                become myopic and hit rock bottom with creativity. Then came
                Mike Ching, introduced through a mutual friend of my husband.
                That was the most fascinating client brief, where we stuck with
                one idea, letting go of others. My husband and I unanimously
                agreed on our current BQ logo, which was loved by our clients
                and well-wishers. It’s so sophisticated for a Sri Lankan salon
                and gave us an edge in the industry. People perceive it as bold,
                sophisticated, and elegant. Thank you, Mike, for this amazing
                output that will last for years to come.”

                “I’ve used Mike a few times over the past few years. What I like
                most is that every time I get a logo, it’s something I haven’t
                seen a million times before. So many designers get inspiration
                from existing logos and modify them slightly. Mike creates the
                popular logos that other designers draw inspiration from.”

                must say is world-class. It was invaluable to hire a branding
                coach who considers logo design his ‘ikigai’ to get the job
                done. This will help us build a world-class online marketplace
                for a world-class product: Ceylon Tea.”
